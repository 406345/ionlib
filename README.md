ion RE Library
==============

The purpose of ion RELib is to aid the development process by reducing boilerplate code.

This project is based off my old Voxation RE libraries (pretty much refactored in C++11), which is located [here](http://github.com/scen/Voxation).

I wanted to switch it up because I was unhappy with the clumsy nested namespaces and clunky inheritance. Progress will be pretty slow, because of school, programming contests and all that good stuff.

This library is built for Visual Studio 2012 (VS110)
